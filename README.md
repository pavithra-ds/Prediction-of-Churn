### Introduction about the project:
Developed a churn prediction model. This model/python code can be used to perform churn prediction for any data.

### Details about sample dataset used: 
-> Dataset was collected  from Kaggle. 
-> There are total 18 columns in both the datasets namely Churn, Tenure, City_Tier, CC_Contacted_LY, Payment, Gender, Service Score, Account_user_count, account_segment, CC_Agent_Score, Marital_Status, rev_per_month, complain_ly, rev_growth_yoy, coupon_used_for_payment, Day_Since_CC_connect, cashback and login_device.  
-> Datasets contains both numeric values, categorical values, missing values and special characters. 

### Tasks Performed :
1. Data cleaning and pre-processing
   -> Identified and handled missing values, special characters and duplicate records, removal of unwanted variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
   -> Performed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, outlier treatment and variable transformation. 
3. Model Building and Interpretation
   -> Built various models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, naive bayes and K-nearest neighbours. 
4. Model Tuning
   -> Performed ensemble modeling, hyperparameter tuning and performance measures. 
5. Model Comparison
   -> Compared models on basis of parameters precision, recall, accuracy, AUC and F-1 score.
