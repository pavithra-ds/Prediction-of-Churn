# Prediction-of-Churn

------
### Introduction :
Developed a churn prediction model

### Dataset : 
Dataset of DTH company is used. It was collected  from Kaggle. Datasets contains both numeric and categorical values. It also contains missing values and special characters. There are total 18 columns in both the datasets namely Churn, Tenure, City_Tier, CC_Contacted_LY, Payment, Gender, Service Score, Account_user_count, account_segment, CC_Agent_Score, Marital_Status, rev_per_month, complain_ly, rev_growth_yoy, coupon_used_for_payment, Day_Since_CC_connect, cashback and login_device.  

### Methodology :
1. Data cleaning and pre-processing : Identified and handled missing values, special characters and duplicate records, removal of unwanted variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis : Performed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, outlier treatment and variable transformation. 
3. Model Building and Interpretation : Built various models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, naive bayes and K-nearest neighbours. 
4. Model Tuning : Performed ensemble modeling, hyperparameter tuning and performance measures. 
5. Model Comparison : Compared models on basis of parameters precision, recall, accuracy, AUC and F-1 score.
